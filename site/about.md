## Hi!

I'm just another software engineer who posts stuff on the internet.
You'll find a variety of articles here, but my main focus will be backend projects, devops,
and infrastructure.

Check the home page for my latest content, or browse the list of topics.

## My Values

* **Knowledge sharing** - A developer blog isn't useful if you can't share it with others and incorporate
  what you learned into your own projects. Therefore, I have placed my work unambiguously under open source
  and related licenses, the full terms of which can be viewed below.

* **Minimal design** - There is a reason why many developers prefer to work in the terminal. I have avoided
  flashy graphics and styles so you can focus on the content.

* **Production quality** - While I can't warrant that my work is 100% free of bugs, rest assured that you
  won't find any throwaway code here. Many of my posts are inspired by my experience as an SRE, where the
  approaches have been tested at scale.
